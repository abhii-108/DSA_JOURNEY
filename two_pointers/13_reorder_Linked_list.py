#Rearrange a given linked list in-place

# Given a singly linked list L0 -> L1 -> â€¦ -> Ln-1 -> Ln. 
# Rearrange the nodes in the list so that the newly formed list is : L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 -> L2 -> Ln-2 ... You are required to do this in place without altering the nodes' values. 

# Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
# Output: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3  
# Explanation: Here n = 4, so the correct order is L0->L3->L1->L2

# Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 
# Output: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
# Explanation: Here n = 4, so the correct order is L0->L4->L1->L3->L2
