#Program for Square Root of Integer using binary search
# Given a positive integer n, find its square root. If n is not a perfect square, then return floor of âˆšn.

# Input: n = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2.

# Input: n = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The square root of 11 lies in between 3 and 4 so floor of the square root is 3.
