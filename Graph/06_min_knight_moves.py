# ## LC Minimum Knight Moves
# In this problem, we are given an infinite chess board that can be imagined as an endless grid with coordinates ranging from negative infinity to positive infinity. We have a chess pieceâ€”a knightâ€”placed at the origin [0, 0] of this grid. The objective is to calculate the minimum number of moves that the knight must make to reach a specific square [x, y] on the chessboard.

# A knight in chess moves in an L-shape: it can move two squares in one direction (either horizontally or vertically) and then make a 90-degree turn to move one square in a perpendicular direction. This gives the knight a total of eight possible moves at any given point.

# The problem requires us to determine the least number of moves necessary to get the knight from its starting position [0, 0] to any target coordinates [x, y]. The question assures that it is always possible to reach the target square.
