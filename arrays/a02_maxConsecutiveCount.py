# Maximum consecutive oneâ€™s (or zeros) in a binary array

# Given an array arr[] consisting of only 0's and 1's, the task is to find the count of a maximum number of consecutive 1's or 0's present in the array.

# Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array is 4 from index 8-11.

# Input: arr[] = {0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1}
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum number of consecutive 0's in the array is 2 from index 0-1.

# Input: arr[] = {0, 0, 0, 0}
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum number of consecutive 0's in the array is 4.
