## Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
# Need to connect each node to its "next right" neighbor


# op should be like this if we iterate it 
# 1 -> null
# 2 -> 3 -> null
# 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> null

# Here is a step-by-step plan for the BFS approach:

# Initialize a queue: Start with a queue containing the root node.

# Process level by level: Use a while loop that continues as long as the queue isn't empty. Inside the loop, get the size of the queue to know how many nodes are on the current level.

# Connect nodes: Use a for loop to iterate size times, processing one node at a time. Keep track of the previous_node from the same level.

# Dequeue and connect: Dequeue the current_node. If there's a previous_node (meaning it's not the first node on the level), set its next pointer to the current_node. Then, update the previous_node to the current_node.

# Enqueue children: Add the left and right children of the current_node to the queue for the next level's processing.

# This method guarantees that each node is connected to its right sibling, and the last node on each level correctly points to None. This approach works for all binary trees, not just perfect ones.
