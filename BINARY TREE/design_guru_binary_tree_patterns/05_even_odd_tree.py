# A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:

# The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.
# For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
# For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).
# Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return false.

# Input: root = [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The node values on each level are:
# Level 0: [1]
# Level 1: [10,4]
# Level 2: [3,7,9]
# Level 3: [12,8,6,2]
# Since levels 0 and 2 are all odd and increasing and levels 1 and 3 are all even and decreasing, the tree is Even-Odd.
