# Implement a stack using singly linked lis
# To implement a stack using a singly linked list, we need to ensure that all operations follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. This means that the most recently added element is always the first one to be removed. In this approach, we use a singly linked list, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node.

# To manage the stack, we maintain a top pointer that always points to the most recent (topmost) node in the stack. The key stack operationsâ€”push, pop, and peek can be performed using this top pointer

# Stack Operations
# push(): Insert a new element into the stack (i.e just insert a new element at the beginning of the linked list.)
# pop(): Return the top element of the Stack (i.e simply delete the first element from the linked list.)
# peek(): Return the top element.
# display(): Print all elements in Stack.
